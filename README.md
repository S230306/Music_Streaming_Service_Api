## Data Flow

The data flow in the application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with the following components:

### Controller

The controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests, processing the data, and returning appropriate responses. They act as the intermediary between the frontend and backend services. In this application, the controllers handle user authentication, music playback, playlists management, and other related functionalities.

### Services

The services are the core logic of the application. They handle business logic, interact with the database through repositories, and perform operations such as user authentication, music streaming, playlist creation, and user preferences.

### Repository

The repositories act as a bridge between the application and the database. They handle database operations, including querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. In this project, repositories are used for handling user data, music metadata, and playlist information.

### Database Design

The application uses a MongoDB database to store various types of data:

1. Users: Information about registered users, including their credentials and preferences.
2. Music Metadata: Details about the music tracks, such as title, artist, album, duration, and genre.
3. Playlists: Data related to user-created playlists, including the list of music tracks associated with each playlist.

The database design ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data to enhance the overall performance of the music streaming application.

## Data Structure Used

The application utilizes the following data structures:

- Objects: Objects are used to represent music tracks, user profiles, and playlist details. They allow for organized data storage with key-value pairs, making it easier to access and modify specific attributes.
- Arrays: Arrays are used for holding lists of items, such as playlists and music track IDs. They provide a convenient way to manage collections of data and perform various operations on them.
